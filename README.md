How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

   Writing code that can be used for multiple projects is something that can be useful to any coder. It helps us from having to repeate code. The code used in the CRUD python module can quickly be modified to work with a different database beside the aac. Making sure you have values that are not hard code and easily adaptable is a great way to make modular code.  

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

   Working with this database was different than other coding I have done before. I hadn't worked with a database much before beside SQL and it didnt involve doing any python code along side it. It was different and having to understand the syntax was a challenge at first. But the more i practiced and worked through our textbook, the easier it became. The knowledge I learned will help me in taking a file and creating a database with it using both python code or mongosh. 

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

   Computer scientists are the people behind any computer screen. They make the programs, the browsers, the games, the software to run tasks, and any other thing you can think of on a computer, all started from a computer scientist. Having the knowledge to take data and sort it in multiple different ways as well as manuipulate the information however we see fit prepares me to work with real databases in the future. Companies like Grazioso Salvare use computer scientist to make their software user friendly and more accessable and convenient. Other companies might use these skills to better their inventory tracking, or keeping track of company vehicles. The possibilites are endless when it comes to the potential of working with databases.
